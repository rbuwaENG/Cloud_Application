## Introduction 

![Alt text](https://github.com/rbuwaENG/Cloud_Application/blob/main/knowledgekube_app%20image/flutter2.JPG?raw=true)

In today's digital era, accessing information is vital for academic success, yet a persistent challenge in 
education is the efficient extraction of text from images and providing accurate answers to questions. 
Traditional methods involve time-consuming manual processes that impede the learning experience. 
To tackle this issue, our team has embarked on developing a mobile application with the following goals: 
	-streamline text extraction from images, enhancing speed and accuracy; provide an intuitive, 
	-user-friendly app for students and educators; 
	-facilitate real-time user interaction and communication; 
	-and harness cloud-based solutions for scalability and accessibility. 
This project's potential impact is substantial, as it has the capacity to enhance educational resource accessibility, 
especially for mobile device users, while also serving as a groundbreaking model for integrating cloud-based solutions and 
AI in education, establishing new benchmarks for efficiency and effectiveness.
 
 
## Problem Definition 

Students often encounter images in textbooks, articles, or classroom materials that contain 
valuable information. Extracting text from these images is not only time-consuming but also 
prone to errors. Educators, on the other hand, struggle to provide timely and accurate answers 
to students' questions. For example, a student studying a history textbook might want to know 
details about a historical event depicted in an image. Our goal was to bridge this gap and enable 
a seamless transition from images to knowledge. 
 
 

## Design and System Architecture 

Our mobile application features a client-server architecture with the server hosted in the cloud. 
The client-side is developed using Flutter, providing cross-platform support for both Android 
and iOS. The front-end design focuses on simplicity, offering an intuitive user interface. On 
the back end, we have a set of microservices that handle distinct functions, including Optical 
Character Recognition (OCR) processing, communication with AI services, and user 
management. Data is securely stored in a cloud-based database, ensuring accessibility and 
scalability.
